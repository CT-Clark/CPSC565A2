# CPSC565A2
This repo holds an implementation of a simplified Quidditch simulation written in Unity for assignment 2 of CPSC565. 

Currently a lot of the code implemented has been based on Unity's TANKS! tutorial as a framework. The tutorial can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=paLLfWd2k5A&list=PLclF8feY8EKLw5Un6Z2Syt2_35qsdpnHt In places where the code looks similar it's because it is and I take no credit for those pieces of code. This project is not to be used for making a profit. 

https://github.com/omaddam/Boids-Simulation has also lent a sizeable amount of code and code ideas to this progect. Likewise any code that looks similar probably is.
